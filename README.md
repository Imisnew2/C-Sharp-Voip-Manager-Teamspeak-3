C--Teamspeak-3-Server-Query-API
===============================

A simple to use C# library that handles asynchronous and synchronous connections to a Teamspeak 3 server.

This library was written to be as simple and as versatile as possible.  I have included example code in Teamspeak.Main on how to use the synchronous and asynchronous features, interpreting responses, and how to build queries.  Enjoy the library, I hope it makes things easier for you.
